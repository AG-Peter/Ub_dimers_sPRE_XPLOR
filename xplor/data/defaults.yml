        This is the name of the potential term assigned to this PSolPot object
        It can contain any string and can be used to 
    restraints:
      type: file
      value: data/diUbi_sPRE_empty_w_CONECT.tbl
      descr: |
        The location of the spre_tble file that will be passed to XPLOR.
        The spre table file needs to be formatted as such:
        f"assign (resid {resSeq:<2} and name HN)  {sPRE:5.3f} {err:5.3f}"
        So for example: For Ubiquitin the first three lines of that table look like this:
        assign (resid 2  and name HN)   5.510   0.711
        assign (resid 3  and name HN)   1.223   1.816
        assign (resid 4  and name HN)   4.381   0.402
  parameters:
    ProbeRadius:
      type: float
      value: 3.5
      descr: Solute radius, used to generate tessellated surface for surface integration. [3.5 angstrom].
    radiusOffset:
      type: float
      value: 3.5
      descr: Amount added to VdW radii given in radii for use in generating the tessellated surface  [3.5 angstrom].
